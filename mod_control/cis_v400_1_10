The format for the rotation schedule depends on the client library that is used. For the gcloud command-line tool, the next rotation time must be in ISO or RFC3339 format, and the rotation period must be in the form INTEGER[UNIT], where units can be one of seconds (s), minutes (m), hours (h) or days (d).",
